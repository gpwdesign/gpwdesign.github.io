      <p class="floatTxt">Capstone is a comprehensive project that is meant to be a showcase for all we have learned so far. We do a massive amount of research and writing all to back up what we are designing. My project was about raising awareness in lost media. I did research on everything from the demographic of people who shop at thrift stores to how media is preserved to how we as people even think of media. My end product was a series of cards that were meant to be placed in thrift stores and other places were second hand media is sold to get the attention of my target demographic. </p>
