      <p class="floatTxt">Gloss was a collaborative project, were the entirety of a Publication II worked together to make a magazine. The class was split into smaller groups that work on specific aspects of the magazine and the group i worked in was the print team, witch was in-charge of creating the packaging of the magazine. When designing for this project collaboration was important as you were not just designing as a single person but part of a larger group and we had to work together so the magazine worked as a cohesive unit.</p>
